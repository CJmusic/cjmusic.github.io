I've created a website. For what purpose you might ask? 

I'm still figuring that out, for now I thought I'd document the process in a post so at least I have something some content to develop around. 

I've recently been developing in [Replit](replit.com), a browser based IDE. You heard me right, I developed this website completely in a browser tab, I didn't install anything on my computer and I'm not paying for any hosting. Everything is being hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and developed in Replit. 

I will preface this by saying I have premium accounts in both. Mainly because then I can have private Repos and Repls. Unfortunately one downside for using these free services, as far as I can tell all code, content, commits etc. for your website must be hosted in a public [GitHub](https://github.com) repo. I don't believe this matters much for my purposes, and I imagine the purposes of many people wishing to build websites. But it's something to keep in mind. 

This tutorial assumes you have both a GitHub and Replit account. If you're starting from nothing, I recommend making GitHub first. Then you can Sign Up to Replit using that account-- which will automatically link the two. I'm also going to assume you know, are familiar with or at least aren't afraid of basic coding workflows and principles. 

### Step One: Creating a Replit Repl and Matching GitHub Repo

It doesn't really matter the order you create things in, if you create the Repl first Replit gives you the option to create a matching Repo on GitHub to store your files and code, and ultimately host your GitHub Pages site. If you create the repo first on GitHub, it's dead simple to link an existing Repl to a GitHub Repository. 

I'm going to start by creating a Blank Repl. On Replit.com go ahead and click create a Repl.

If you wish to host your site on GitHub Pages, you'll need to name the repo: 

	<your_username>.github.io


This gives you the hosting domain of `<your_username>.github.io` Meaning that's the URL that people will go to to visit your website. You can of course purchase a different domain... but that's beyond the focus of this tutorial. Note, any and all Repl's get a `<repl_name>.<user_name>.repl.co` domain free as well.


I suggest you adopt a workflow where your `<your_username>.github.io` is your main published site, and your `<repl_name>.<user_name>.repl.co` where you branch out and do your development and testing. Your changes to repl.co are instant, and it easy to see them in the Webview in the Replit IDE.

If you created the Repo first on GitHub click the import from GitHub button, 

Once you create your Repl and GitHub Repo, open your Repl in Replit and you should be greeted with a screen similar to:

### Step Two: Configuring your environment in Repl, installing Jenkins



### Step Three:
