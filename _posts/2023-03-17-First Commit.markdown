I've created a website. For what purpose you might ask? 

I'm still figuring that out, for now I thought I'd document the process in a post so at least I have something some content to develop around. 

I've recently been developing in [Replit](replit.com), a browser based IDE. You heard me right, a browser based IDE.

That is to say, I developed this website completely in a browser tab, I didn't install anything on my computer and I'm not paying for any hosting. Everything is being hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and developed in Replit. 

I will preface this by saying I have premium accounts in both. Mainly because then I can have private Repos and Repls. Unfortunately one downside for using these free services, as far as I can tell all code, content, commits etc. for your website must be hosted in a public [GitHub](https://github.com) repo. I don't believe this matters much for my purposes, and I imagine the purposes of many people wishing to build websites. But it's something to keep in mind. 

This tutorial assumes you have both a GitHub and Replit account. If you're starting from nothing, I recommend making GitHub first. Then you can Sign Up to Replit using that account-- which will automatically link the two. I'm also going to assume you know, are familiar with or at least aren't afraid of basic coding workflows and principles. 

#### Step One: Creating a Replit Repl and Matching GitHub Repo

It doesn't really matter the order you things in, if you create the Repl first Replit gives you the option to create a matching Repo on GitHub to store your files and code, and ultimately host your GitHub Pages site. If you create the repo first on GitHub, it's dead simple to link an existing Repl to a GitHub Repository. 



#### Step Two: Configuring your environment in Repl, installing Jenkins



#### Step Three:
