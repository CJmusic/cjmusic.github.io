Hello, my name is Chris. I am a musician, audio scientist and part-time website builder and blogger. I studied the physics of vinyl records for my masters research and now work as a software developer in the field of audio. 

I have various projects I'm currently working on which are hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/CJmusic)
