I am a musician, audio scientist and coder. I studied astronomy, physics and vinyl records in school and now work as a software developer in the field of audio. This is my personal website and blog, I mainly talk about music, science, my latest software projects and audio.

I have various projects I'm currently working on which are hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/CJmusic). 

You can check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/chrisjosephyt) channel for music and technology videos including ableton live tutorials, studio updates and desk vids.
